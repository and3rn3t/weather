# Weather App

A modern, cross-platform weather application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 🌟 Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

The weather app is complete and working with real OpenMeteo API integration - completely free with no API key required!

### ✅ Working Features

- **Real Weather Data**: Fetches actual weather from OpenMeteo API (free service)
- **Beautiful Modern UI**: Glassmorphism design with gradients and animations
- **Smart Navigation**: Custom state-based navigation system optimized for web
- **No API Key Required**: Uses free OpenMeteo and OpenStreetMap services
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Animated loading indicators with smooth transitions
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter key to search for weather
- **Imperial Units**: Temperature displayed in Fahrenheit
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile browsers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.12.0+
- npm
- **No API keys required!** 🎉

### Setup

1. **Clone and install:**

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and start checking weather!

2. **Start development server:**

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and start checking weather!

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Home Screen**: Click "Check Weather →" to start
2. **Enter City**: Type any city name (e.g., "London", "New York", "Tokyo")
3. **Get Weather**: Press Enter or click "🔍 Search"
4. **View Results**: See real temperature in Fahrenheit and weather conditions

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### APIs Used

- **OpenMeteo**: Weather data (free, no API key required)
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim**: Geocoding (free, no API key required)

### Key Files

- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Main app with inline screen components and modern UI
- `src/services/weatherService.ts` - Legacy OpenWeatherMap service (kept for reference)

### Important Notes

- ✅ Use inline components in AppNavigator.tsx (works reliably)
- ❌ Avoid separate screen component files (causes blank screens)
- ✅ No API keys required - uses free OpenMeteo and Nominatim services
- ✅ Two-step API process: Nominatim geocoding → OpenMeteo weather data

## 📱 Future Mobile Deployment

The app is built on React Native foundation and ready for mobile deployment:

- **iOS**: Use Expo or React Native CLI
- **Android**: Use Expo or React Native CLI

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```powershell
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern frosted glass effects with blur
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Beautiful purple-to-blue gradients
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and loading animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Imperial Units**: Temperature displayed in Fahrenheit
