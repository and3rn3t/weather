## 📱 Mobile Features

### Haptic Feedback System

The app features an advanced haptic feedback system with:

- **30+ Weather-Specific Patterns**: Unique vibrations for different weather conditions
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Intensity varies by temperature, time of day, and weather severity
- **Progressive Feedback**: Multi-stage haptics for complex interactions
- **Battery Optimization**: Smart triggering with rate limiting and intensity scaling

#### Weather Haptic Patterns

```typescript
// Clear weather - gentle pulse
clear: [15, 60, 15]

// Rain - rhythmic droplet simulation  
rainy: [30, 20, 30, 20, 30]

// Thunderstorm - powerful strike pattern
thunderstorm: [80, 40, 60]

// Wind - gusting wind simulation
windy: [20, 40, 30, 60, 40]
```

### Location Services

- **Automatic Detection**: GPS-based location with fallback to IP geolocation
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent storage with automatic cleanup
- **Background Updates**: Periodic location refresh with battery awareness
- **Network Optimization**: Adaptive behavior based on connection quality

### Swipe Navigation

- **Bi-directional Swiping**: Navigate between Home and Weather screens
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators and smooth animations
- **Haptic Integration**: Touch feedback during swipe interactions
- **Gesture Recognition**: Velocity-based swipe detection with thresholds
