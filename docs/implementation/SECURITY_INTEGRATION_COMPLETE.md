- ✅ **Grouped Updates**: Related packages updated together
- ✅ **Security Patches**: Immediate security vulnerability fixes

### 4. CI/CD Integration Points

#### 4.1 GitHub Actions Integration

- ✅ **Security Artifacts**: Reports uploaded to workflow artifacts
- ✅ **Status Checks**: Security gates integrated with branch protection
- ✅ **Action Outputs**: Security status available to downstream jobs
- ✅ **Notifications**: GitHub Actions notices/warnings for issues

#### 4.2 Performance Integration

- ✅ **Bundle Security**: Performance budgets as security measures
- ✅ **Dependency Audits**: npm audit integrated with security scanning
- ✅ **Size Monitoring**: Bundle size monitoring for supply chain security

2. CodeQL security analysis
3. Snyk dependency and code scanning
4. License compliance validation
5. Performance budget enforcement
6. Security report generation
```

### Security Incident Response

```bash
# Check current security status
npm run security:dashboard

# Detailed vulnerability analysis
npm run security:scan
npm run security:code

# License compliance audit
npm run license:check

# Generate comprehensive report
npm run security:monitor
```
