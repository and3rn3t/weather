## ðŸ†• Mobile UI & Accessibility Optimizations (2025)

- All buttons and interactive elements have `aria-label` attributes for accessibility
- Touch targets are 44px+ and use utility classes for consistent sizing
- CSS utility classes ensure maintainable, performant layouts
- WeatherIcon and MobileDebug are memoized for better performance
- Animations use transform/opacity for smoothness
- Test accessibility and touch responsiveness on real devices and emulators
