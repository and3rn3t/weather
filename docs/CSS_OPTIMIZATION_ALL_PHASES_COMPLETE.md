## 🧹 **Cleanup Recommendations**

### **Files That Can Be Safely Archived**

The following files have been consolidated and are no longer needed in active imports:

**Phase 4 Consolidation (iOS26 System):**

- ~~iOS26.css~~ → consolidated
- ~~iOS26Components.css~~ → consolidated
- ~~iOS26DesignSystem.css~~ → consolidated
- ~~iOS26WeatherInterface.css~~ → consolidated
- ~~modernWeatherUI.css~~ → consolidated
- ~~enhancedWeatherDisplay.css~~ → consolidated
- ~~enhancedForecast.css~~ → consolidated

**Previous Phase Consolidations:**

- ~~horror-\*.css files~~ → `horror-theme-consolidated.css`
- ~~responsive-\*.css files~~ → `responsive-layout-consolidated.css`
- ~~mobile-enhancement-\*.css files~~ → `mobile-enhanced-consolidated.css`

### **Archive Strategy**

1. **Move to archive folder**: `src/styles/archive/phase-[1-4]-original/`
2. **Keep as reference**: Files contain useful patterns for future development
3. **Document in archive**: Include this completion report in each phase folder
