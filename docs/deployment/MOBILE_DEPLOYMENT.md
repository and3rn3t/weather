# Mobile Deployment Guide - Premium Weather App

This guide will walk you through deploying the Premium Weather App to iOS and Android devices using Capacitor.

## Overview

Our React web app is now ready for mobile deployment using Capacitor, which wraps web apps in native containers while providing access to native device features.

### What's Included

âœ… **Capacitor Configuration**: Complete setup for iOS and Android
âœ… **PWA Foundation**: Service worker, manifest, and offline support
âœ… **Native Plugins**: Haptics, geolocation, notifications, and more
âœ… **Mobile Optimization**: Touch events, responsive design, pull-to-refresh
âœ… **Automated Setup**: PowerShell script for easy installation

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Setup Script

```powershell
npm run mobile:setup
```

This will automatically:
- Install Capacitor CLI and dependencies
- Initialize the Capacitor project
- Build the web app
- Add Android/iOS platforms
- Sync the project

### 2. Open Native Development Environment

**For Android:**
```powershell
npm run mobile:open:android
```

**For iOS (macOS only):**
```powershell
npm run mobile:open:ios
```

### 3. Run on Device

**Android:**
```powershell
npm run mobile:android
```

**iOS:**
```powershell
npm run mobile:ios
```

npm run mobile:ios           # Run on iOS device/simulator
npm run mobile:open:android  # Open Android Studio
npm run mobile:open:ios      # Open Xcode

# Testing
npm run test                 # Run test suite
npm run test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage
```

## Configuration

### App Configuration (`capacitor.config.json`)

Key settings for your mobile app:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.weatherapp.premium",
  "appName": "Premium Weather",
  "webDir": "dist"
}
```

### Native Features Enabled

- **Haptic Feedback**: Touch vibrations for enhanced UX
- **Geolocation**: GPS-based weather detection
- **Local Notifications**: Weather alerts and updates
- **Push Notifications**: Server-sent notifications
- **Status Bar**: Themed status bar matching app design
- **Splash Screen**: Branded loading screen
- **Keyboard Management**: Proper keyboard handling
- **Network Status**: Online/offline detection
- **Device Information**: Platform and version detection
- **Share API**: Share weather data with other apps

## Deployment Steps

### Android Deployment

1. **Open Android Studio**:
   ```powershell
   npm run mobile:open:android
   ```

2. **Configure Signing**:
   - Go to Build â†’ Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Create or use existing keystore
   - Configure app signing in `capacitor.config.json`

3. **Build APK/AAB**:
   - Build â†’ Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) â†’ Build APK(s)
   - Or use: Build â†’ Generate Signed Bundle/APK

4. **Test on Device**:
   - Enable Developer Options on Android device
   - Enable USB Debugging
   - Connect device and run: `npm run mobile:android`

### iOS Deployment (macOS only)

1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```powershell
   npm run mobile:open:ios
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Android Build Errors:**
- Ensure ANDROID_HOME environment variable is set
- Update Android SDK and build tools
- Check Java version (JDK 11+ required)

**iOS Build Errors:**
- Update Xcode to latest version
- Check bundle identifier uniqueness
- Verify Apple Developer Team membership

**Web App Not Updating:**
- Run `npm run mobile:build` to rebuild and sync
- Clear app data on device
- Uninstall and reinstall app

### Debug Commands

```powershell
# Check Capacitor environment
npx cap doctor

# List available devices
npx cap run android --list
npx cap run ios --list

# Live reload during development
npx cap run android --livereload
npx cap run ios --livereload
```

## Performance Optimization

### Web Performance
- Minimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Optimize images and assets
- Use service worker for caching
- Enable gzip compression

### Native Performance
- Use hardware acceleration for animations
- Optimize touch event handling
- Minimize native bridge calls
- Cache frequently accessed data

## App Store Guidelines

### Android (Google Play)
- Target API level 33+ (Android 13)
- Include required permissions in manifest
- Provide app screenshots and descriptions
- Follow Material Design guidelines

### iOS (App Store)
- Support latest iOS versions
- Include required privacy descriptions
- Provide app screenshots for all devices
- Follow Human Interface Guidelines

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement certificate pinning for production
- Sanitize user input and API responses
- Store sensitive data in secure storage
- Enable app transport security (iOS)

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** on real devices
2. **Configure app icons** and splash screens
3. **Set up crash reporting** (Sentry, Crashlytics)
4. **Implement analytics** (Google Analytics, Firebase)
5. **Configure CI/CD** for automated builds
6. **Submit to app stores** for review
