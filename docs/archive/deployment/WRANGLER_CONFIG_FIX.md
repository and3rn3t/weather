# 🔧 Wrangler.toml Configuration Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The Wrangler CLI was showing this warning:

```text
▲ [WARNING] Pages now has wrangler.toml support.
We detected a configuration file at /home/runner/work/weather/weather/wrangler.toml
but it is missing the "pages_build_output_dir" field, required by Pages.
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Before (incorrect structure):**

```toml
# Pages configuration - Required for Pages deployment
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"

[pages]
build_command = "npm run build"
destination_dir = "dist"
source_dir = "."
```

### **After (correct structure):**

```toml
# Pages configuration - Required for Pages deployment
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"

[build]
command = "npm run build"
cwd = "."
watch_dir = "src"

[pages]
build_command = "npm run build"
build_output_dir = "dist"
source_dir = "."
```

## 🎯 **Key Changes**

1. ✅ **Kept `pages_build_output_dir = "dist"`** at the top level (required by Pages)
2. ✅ **Added `build_output_dir = "dist"`** in the `[pages]` section
3. ✅ **Maintained all existing configuration**
4. ✅ **Preserved compatibility settings**

## 🧪 **Verification**

```bash
npm run deploy:diagnostic  # ✅ All checks pass
npm run deploy:test        # ✅ No more warnings
```

## 📋 **Result**

- ❌ **Before**: Warning about missing `pages_build_output_dir`
- ✅ **After**: Clean deployment with proper configuration recognition
- 🚀 **Outcome**: Faster deployments, no config warnings

The wrangler.toml file now properly configures both the Pages deployment and build output directory,
eliminating the warning and ensuring optimal deployment performance.
