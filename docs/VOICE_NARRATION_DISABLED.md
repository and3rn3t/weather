# Voice Narration Configuration

## Overview

Voice narration and accessibility audio announcements in the weather app are **disabled by default**
for privacy and user experience reasons.

## What Was Disabled

- **Automatic voice narration** of screen changes and weather updates
- **Audio accessibility announcements** for navigation and state changes
- **Auto-announce weather** feature that speaks weather conditions automatically
- **Screen reader integration** that speaks UI element changes

## Default Configuration

All voice/audio features now default to `false`:

```typescript
// Main Multi-Sensory Configuration (AppNavigator.tsx)
const multiSensory = useMultiSensoryWeather({
  enableAudio: false, // No audio narration
  enableAccessibility: false, // No accessibility announcements
  autoAnnounceWeather: false, // No automatic weather speaking
  enableHaptics: true, // Haptic feedback still enabled (non-invasive)
});

// Weather Announcements Hook (useMultiSensoryWeather.ts)
useWeatherAnnouncements({
  enableAudio: false, // No audio
  enableAccessibility: false, // No voice announcements
  autoAnnounceWeather: false, // No automatic speaking
});
```

## What Still Works

- **Haptic feedback** - Still enabled by default (vibration/touch feedback)
- **Visual UI updates** - All visual elements work normally
- **Manual controls** - Users can still manually enable features if desired

## How Voice Narration Was Being Triggered

Previously, voice narration would speak automatically for:

1. **Navigation changes** - "Switched to Home screen", "Opened search"
2. **Weather updates** - "Weather data refreshed", "Loading weather data"
3. **Theme changes** - "Switched to dark theme"
4. **Search actions** - "Location found", "Search completed"
5. **Error states** - "Error loading weather data"
6. **State changes** - "App is offline", "Data refreshed"

## How to Re-enable (For Users Who Want It)

If users want voice narration, developers can create settings to enable:

```typescript
// To enable voice narration
const multiSensory = useMultiSensoryWeather({
  enableAudio: true, // Enable audio narration
  enableAccessibility: true, // Enable accessibility features
  autoAnnounceWeather: true, // Enable automatic weather announcements
  audioVolume: 0.6, // Set appropriate volume
});
```

## Components Affected

- `AppNavigator.tsx` - Main configuration updated
- `MobileNavigation.tsx` - Navigation announcements now silent
- `SearchScreen.tsx` - Search result announcements now silent
- `ThemeToggle.tsx` - Theme change announcements now silent
- `IOSHIGNavigation.tsx` - Navigation announcements now silent

## Privacy Benefits

- **No automatic microphone usage** - App doesn't request speech permissions
- **No unexpected audio** - App is silent unless explicitly enabled
- **User control** - Users must actively choose to enable voice features
- **WCAG compliance** - Still accessible through screen readers when needed

## Technical Implementation

- Modified `useMultiSensoryWeather` hook defaults
- Updated `useWeatherAnnouncements` hook configuration
- Added utility functions `isVoiceNarrationEnabled()` and `isAutoWeatherAnnouncementsEnabled()`
- All existing components continue to work, just silently

The app now respects user privacy by being silent by default while maintaining all functionality for
users who choose to enable voice features.
